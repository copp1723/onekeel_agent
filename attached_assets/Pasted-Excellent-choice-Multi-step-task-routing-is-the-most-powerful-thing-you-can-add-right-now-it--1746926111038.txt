Excellent choice. Multi-step task routing is the **most powerful thing you can add right now** — it turns AgentFlow from a tool executor into a real agent that can **think through** and **orchestrate** multi-action tasks.

## 🔧 What This Will Add

AgentFlow will now be able to:

> *“Extract content from this site and summarize it.”*

Or:

> *“Crawl this competitor’s pricing page, then tell me what changed from last week.”*

It will:

1. Parse the task
2. Decide which tools to run (and in what order)
3. Run them step-by-step
4. Return a final output

### Replit Agent — Add Multi-Step Routing with Intelligent Tool Chaining

Please add support for **multi-step task execution**. This should allow AgentFlow to handle complex instructions that require more than one tool.

#### ✅ Step 1: Update the Task Parser

* Detect when a task contains **multiple actions** or needs to be broken into substeps.
* Output a plan like:

```ts
{
  steps: [
    { tool: "extractCleanContent", input: { url: "https://example.com" } },
    { tool: "summarizeText", input: { text: "{{step0.output}}" } }
  ]
}
```

* Each step should be run in order, passing outputs into inputs as needed.

#### ✅ Step 2: Add Execution Engine

* In a new file (e.g. `src/agent/executePlan.ts`), implement logic to:

  * Loop through each step
  * Execute the registered tool with its input
  * Store output and make it available to future steps (e.g., `{{step0.output}}` templating)
  * Return the final output (or all outputs)

#### ✅ Step 3: Modify the Agent Flow

* In `index.ts`, when a task is received:

  * Run `taskParser.parse(task)` to get a multi-step plan
  * Pass that plan to `executePlan()`
  * Return the result to the user

#### ✅ Step 4: Add a `summarizeText` tool

* Simple tool that accepts a text input and uses OpenAI to summarize it.
* This will be used as the second step after extracting content.

#### ✅ Step 5: Add a test plan

* Example task:
  *“Summarize the content of [https://example.com”](https://example.com”)*
* This should trigger: extractCleanContent → summarizeText
