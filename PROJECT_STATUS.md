# AgentFlow Project Status

## Current Status: Pre-Deployment

The AgentFlow project is currently in a pre-deployment state with several issues that need to be addressed before it can be successfully deployed.

## Key Components

1. **Backend Services**: Node.js/TypeScript application with Express API
2. **Frontend**: Next.js application for user interface
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
4. **AI Integration**: Uses Eko AI and OpenAI for analysis
5. **Email Services**: For notifications and report ingestion
6. **Task Scheduling**: For automated workflows

## Critical Issues

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- 255 errors in 46 files
- Most errors are related to missing type definitions for dependencies
- Need to install proper @types packages and fix type errors

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- Several dependencies appear to be missing or not properly installed
- Need to run `npm install` with the correct packages

### 3. Database Configuration
- Database connection is not properly set up
- Need to configure Supabase or alternative database

### 4. Environment Variables
- Environment variables are incomplete
- Need to update .env file with all required variables

### 5. Git Repository Setup
- No remote repository is configured
- Need to set up Git repository for deployment

## Action Items

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Create comprehensive .env file
- [x] Create project status document
- [x] Create script for installing missing dependencies (install-dependencies.sh)
- [ ] Install missing dependencies
- [ ] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Create script for setting up Git repository (setup-git-repository.sh)
- [ ] Set up Git repository

### Secondary Tasks
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Run and test the application locally
- [ ] Deploy the application
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Features Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Core Backend | Incomplete | TypeScript errors need fixing |
| Frontend | Incomplete | Needs testing after backend is fixed |
| Database Integration | Incomplete | Connection issues need to be resolved |
| Email Services | Incomplete | Needs testing |
| Task Scheduling | Incomplete | Needs testing |
| AI Integration | Incomplete | Depends on API keys |

## Next Steps

1. Fix the TypeScript compilation errors by installing the required dependencies
2. Test the database connection
3. Set up the Git repository for deployment
4. Run the application locally to verify functionality
5. Deploy the application to production
