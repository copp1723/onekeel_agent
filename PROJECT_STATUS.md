# AgentFlow Project Status

## Current Status: Pre-Deployment

The AgentFlow project is currently in a pre-deployment state with several issues that need to be addressed before it can be successfully deployed.

## Key Components

1. **Backend Services**: Node.js/TypeScript application with Express API
2. **Frontend**: Next.js application for user interface
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
4. **AI Integration**: Uses Eko AI and OpenAI for analysis
5. **Email Services**: For notifications and report ingestion
6. **Task Scheduling**: For automated workflows

## Critical Issues

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- 255 errors in 46 files
- Most errors are related to missing type definitions for dependencies
- Need to install proper @types packages and fix type errors

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- Several dependencies appear to be missing or not properly installed
- Need to run `npm install` with the correct packages

### 3. Database Configuration
- Database connection is not properly set up
- Need to configure Supabase or alternative database

### 4. Environment Variables
- Environment variables are incomplete
- Need to update .env file with all required variables

### 5. Git Repository Setup
- No remote repository is configured
- Need to set up Git repository for deployment

## Action Items

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Create comprehensive .env file
- [x] Create project status document
- [x] Create script for installing missing dependencies (install-dependencies.sh)
