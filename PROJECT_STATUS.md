# AgentFlow Project Status

## Project Overview

AgentFlow is a platform for automating workflows using AI agents. It provides a way to create, manage, and execute tasks using natural language instructions. The platform includes a job queue system, a task scheduler, and a web API for interacting with the system.

## Current Status

### Completed Features

- **Core Agent Framework**: The core agent framework is complete, allowing for the execution of tasks using AI agents.
- **Task Parser**: The task parser can convert natural language instructions into structured tasks with execution plans.
- **Job Queue System**: The job queue system is operational, allowing for the scheduling and execution of jobs.
- **API Server**: The API server is operational, providing endpoints for interacting with the system.
- **Health Monitoring**: The health monitoring system is operational, providing endpoints for checking the health of the system.
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication is implemented using session cookies.

### In Progress Features

- **TypeScript Migration**: The codebase is being migrated to TypeScript to improve type safety and developer experience.
- **API Documentation**: The API documentation is being updated to include all endpoints and schemas.
- **Workflow Scheduler**: The workflow scheduler is being implemented to allow for the scheduling of recurring tasks.
- **Email Notifications**: Email notifications are being implemented to notify users of task completion and other events.

### Planned Features

- **User Dashboard**: A user dashboard will be implemented to allow users to view and manage their tasks and workflows.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Advanced analytics will be implemented to provide insights into task execution and system performance.
- **Integration with External Services**: Integration with external services such as Slack, GitHub, and Jira will be implemented.
- **Mobile App**: A mobile app will be developed to allow users to interact with the system on the go.

## Technical Debt

- **Test Coverage**: Test coverage is currently low and needs to be improved.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase and needs to be standardized.
- **Documentation**: Code documentation is sparse and needs to be improved.
- **TypeScript Migration**: Some parts of the codebase still use JavaScript and need to be migrated to TypeScript.

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

- **Express**: Web framework for the API server.
- **Drizzle ORM**: ORM for database access.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing tasks, jobs, and other data.
- **Redis**: Used for the job queue and caching.
- **Anthropic Claude**: AI model used for task parsing and execution.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language for type safety.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.

### Development Dependencies

- **ESLint**: Linting tool for code quality.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter.
- **Jest**: Testing framework.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript compiler.
- **ts-node**: TypeScript execution environment.
- **nodemon**: Development server with auto-reload.

## Known Issues

- **TypeScript Errors**: There are still some TypeScript errors in the codebase that need to be fixed.
- **API Documentation**: The API documentation is incomplete and needs to be updated.
- **Workflow Scheduler**: The workflow scheduler has some issues with recurring tasks.
- **Email Notifications**: Email notifications are not working correctly for all events.
- **Authentication**: Authentication is basic and needs to be improved for production use.

## Roadmap

### Short-term (1-3 months)

- Complete the TypeScript migration.
- Fix all TypeScript errors.
- Complete the API documentation.
- Implement the workflow scheduler.
- Implement email notifications.
- Improve test coverage.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

- Implement the user dashboard.
- Implement advanced analytics.
- Integrate with external services.
- Improve error handling.
- Improve code documentation.

### Long-term (6-12 months)

- Develop the mobile app.
- Implement advanced authentication.
- Implement advanced security features.
- Scale the system for production use.
- Implement advanced monitoring and alerting.

## Conclusion

The AgentFlow project is making good progress, with many core features already implemented. The focus is now on improving the developer experience with TypeScript, completing the API documentation, and implementing the remaining features. There are some known issues that need to be addressed, but the project is on track to meet its goals.
