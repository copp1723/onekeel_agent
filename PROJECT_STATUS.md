# AgentFlow Project Status

## Current Status: Pre-Deployment

The AgentFlow project is currently in a pre-deployment state with several issues that need to be addressed before it can be successfully deployed.

## Key Components

1. **Backend Services**: Node.js/TypeScript application with Express API
2. **Frontend**: Next.js application for user interface
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
4. **AI Integration**: Uses Eko AI and OpenAI for analysis
5. **Email Services**: For notifications and report ingestion
6. **Task Scheduling**: For automated workflows

## Critical Issues

### 1. Remaining TypeScript Errors
- 951 TypeScript errors in 99 files need to be fixed
- Most errors are related to import paths, missing type declarations, and incorrect type usage
- The TypeScript error fixing script has been run and has fixed many issues
- Remaining errors are primarily in test files and related to import paths with double extensions (.js.js)
- Manual fixes are needed for some specific issues like duplicate identifiers and type mismatches

### 2. Test Type Coverage
- Test files need to be updated to use proper TypeScript types
- Mock implementations need to be fixed to use correct type definitions
- Need to add more comprehensive tests for TypeScript components

### 3. Database Configuration
- Database connection is not properly set up
- Need to configure Supabase or alternative database

### 4. Environment Variables
- Environment variables are incomplete
- Need to update .env file with all required variables

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Deployment configuration is incomplete
- Need to set up CD pipeline for automated deployment

   ```

   The script now includes fixes for:
   - Import path errors (adding .js extensions to relative imports)
   - Type mismatch errors (fixing EmailSendOptions missing 'from' property)
   - Unknown type errors (proper error handling with type guards)
   - Property missing errors (fixing Drizzle ORM where method issues)
   - Unused import errors (removing unused imports)
   - Drizzle ORM issues (fixing insert().values(), orderBy, and returning)

2. Manually fix any remaining errors by running:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. Convert remaining JavaScript files to TypeScript:
   - Focus on core service files and utilities
   - Update imports to use TypeScript files
   - Remove duplicate JavaScript files after successful conversion

4. Improve test type coverage:
   - Update test files to use proper TypeScript types
   - Fix mock implementations to use correct type definitions

5. Apply the error handling patterns to other parts of the codebase

6. Implement the error handling middleware in the Express application

7. Add more unit tests for other service layer components

8. Enhance the attachment parsers with more sophisticated PDF extraction

9. Add support for more file formats (e.g., JSON, XML)

10. Implement more advanced deduplication logic based on content hashing

11. Create a dashboard for monitoring the data flow pipeline

12. Test the database connection

13. Run the application locally to verify functionality

14. Deploy the application to production

15. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness in production

16. Expand CI pipeline to include automated deployment
