# Ticket 1: Remove Legacy Credential and Vendor Setup from UI - Summary

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **Home Page (frontend/src/app/page.tsx)**
   - Removed the CredentialForm and CredentialsList components
   - Updated the layout to focus on the TaskForm component

2. **TaskForm Component (frontend/src/components/TaskForm.tsx)**
   - Removed dependency on credentials
   - Updated to use predefined platforms from a configuration instead of getting them from credentials
   - Updated the validation rules and form submission logic

3. **CredentialForm Component (frontend/src/components/CredentialForm.tsx)**
   - Replaced with a deprecation notice
   - Added JSDoc deprecation annotation

4. **CredentialsList Component (frontend/src/components/CredentialsList.tsx)**
   - Replaced with a deprecation notice
   - Added JSDoc deprecation annotation

### Backend Changes

1. **Credential Routes (src/server/routes/credentials.ts)**
   - Added deprecation notices to all credential management API endpoints
   - Added deprecation headers to all credential management API responses
   - Kept the API endpoints functional for existing users

2. **Documentation**
   - Created a migration guide (docs/CREDENTIAL-MIGRATION.md) explaining the changes and migration path for existing users

## Testing

The changes have been tested by:
- Running the frontend development server
- Verifying that the UI no longer shows credential management components
- Verifying that the TaskForm component works with predefined platforms

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on the usage of the deprecated API endpoints to determine when they can be safely removed
2. **User Communication**: Inform existing users about the deprecation and migration path
3. **Complete Removal**: In a future release, completely remove the credential management UI and API endpoints

## Conclusion

The legacy credential and vendor setup has been successfully removed from the UI while ensuring nothing breaks for existing users. The UI is now more intuitive and focused on the core functionality of requesting analyses.
